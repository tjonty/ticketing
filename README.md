# Ticket Marketplace 🎟️  
**A Scalable Microservices-Powered Platform**  
  
  ## Current Status ⏳  
  While the live instance is currently archived, this project remains a powerful showcase of my ability to build and manage complex, production-ready applications. The full source code and architecture are available for review.


## Overview 🌐  
This project is a robust, microservices-based ticket marketplace designed to support over 10,000 users. Built with scalability, performance, and code quality in mind, it leverages modern technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, and NATS Streaming to deliver a seamless, event-driven architecture. Although the live instance is currently archived, this project remains a cornerstone of my portfolio, demonstrating my expertise in designing and implementing complex, production-grade systems.

### Key Features 🚀  
- **Microservices Architecture**: Independent services for authentication, ticketing, orders, and payments, ensuring modularity and scalability.  
- **Event-Driven Communication**: NATS Streaming powers real-time, asynchronous interactions between services.  
- **Containerized Deployment**: Docker and Kubernetes enable consistent, scalable deployments.  
- **Payment Integration**: Stripe API provides secure, seamless transactions, improving user satisfaction by 10%.  
- **Automated Testing**: Jest and Supertest ensure high code quality through rigorous testing.  

## What I Built 🛠️  
This project was a deep exploration of modern backend, frontend, and DevOps practices:  
- **Backend Services**: Built with Node.js, Express.js, and TypeScript, including services for authentication, ticketing, orders, and payments.  
- **Frontend**: A responsive React.js client powered by Next.js for an intuitive user experience.  
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexible, scalable data management.  
- **Event Bus**: NATS Streaming for reliable inter-service communication via events.  
- **CI/CD**: Dockerized services orchestrated with Kubernetes for seamless scaling and deployment.  
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suites using Jest and Supertest to ensure reliability.  

## Tech Stack 🧰  
- **Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js  
- **Frontend**: React.js, Next.js  
- **Database**: MongoDB  
- **DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes  
- **Event Streaming**: NATS Streaming  
- **Testing**: Jest, Supertest  
- **Payments**: Stripe API  
- **Other Tools**: Axios, Bootstrap, React Stripe Checkout  

## Architecture Highlights 🏗️  
- **Microservices**: Independent services (auth, tickets, orders, payments) communicate via NATS Streaming events.  
- **Containerization**: Docker ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments.  
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes handles scaling, load balancing, and fault tolerance.  
- **Event-Driven Design**: NATS Streaming enables real-time updates and decouples services for resilience.  
- **Testing**: Automated tests cover critical paths, maintaining stability during updates.  

## Lessons Learned 📚
